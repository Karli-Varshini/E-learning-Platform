**Overview for E-Learning Platform**

**Objective:**
The E-Learning Platform is a desktop-based application designed to provide users with a personalized learning experience. The platform allows users to log in, view available courses, and enroll in them. Once enrolled, users can track their progress in each course. The goal is to offer a user-friendly interface that simplifies the process of accessing and managing online educational content.

**Key Features:**

**User Authentication:** Simple login system to recognize users and tailor the learning experience to individual needs.

**Course Management:** Users can view a list of available courses, read detailed descriptions, and enroll in courses of their choice.

**Progress Tracking:** Users can monitor their progress in each enrolled course.

**Responsive UI:** The platform uses a card layout to navigate between different sections such as login, profile, courses, and course details.

**Technology Used:**

**Java:** The primary programming language used to develop the application, leveraging its robust features for desktop GUI development.

**Swing:** A GUI widget toolkit for Java, used to create the graphical interface of the platform, including buttons, labels, text fields, and panels.

**CardLayout:** A layout manager for managing multiple components (panels) that share the same display space, providing a smooth navigation experience between different sections of the platform.

**Collections Framework:** Utilizes Javaâ€™s Map interface (HashMap) to store and manage user data and course details efficiently.

This platform serves as a foundational structure for e-learning, which can be expanded with additional features like quizzes, multimedia content, and more sophisticated user management in future iterations.
